* #### _The app handles new pie card creation after user clicks on the nav button. The PieForm component is rendered and once the user clicks submit, a new pie is added to the beginning parent's state array. On next render, this new card will display at the first position._

* #### _The app utilizes css grid to handle dynamically added cards which space and size accordingly._

* #### _Card images are clickable which will display more details!_





## Setup/Installation Requirements
* `Clone repo, run npm install, type "npm start" (you may have to refresh the page once for it to load). Card images are clickable which will display the card details!`

## Specifications:
  * Spec 1: The app loads with 4 cards featuring 4 different pies. These are created dynamically using an array of objects stored in state.

  * Spec 2: Each card has a button which decrements the count by 1 for that specific pie's state. Logic is built in which prevents further decrements below 0.
    
  * Spec 3: PieCard and PieForm are completely reusable components with proptypes. 

  * Spec 4: Clicking on any card image will display a details div. Each pie has it's own state for this hidden content.
